# Function Description:
This function performs the LU factorization of a square matrix given the input of a square matrix

# Inputs: 

**A** - This input represents some square matrix the user inputs

# Outputs:

**L** - This output is the lower triangular matrix found during the LU factorization of square matrix A

**U** - This output is the upper triangular matrix found during the LU factorization of square matrix A

**P** - This output is the pivot matrix found during the LU factorization of square matrix A]

# Limitations: 

A square matrix must be input (number of columns = number of rows)

Divisions by zero are avoided in factorization through pivoting
