# _**MECH 105 Algorithms**_

## **Summary of Repository**
This repository contains algorithms developed in class for MECH 105: Mechanical Engineering Problem Solving

## Days Elapsed Function
This function determines the number of elapsed days since the beginning of a given year given some date during the year
## False Position Function
This function estimats the root of a given function using the false position numerical method
## LU Factorization Function
This function performs the LU factorization of a square matrix given the input of a square matrix. 
## Simpson's Method Function 
This function calculates the integral of experimental data using the Simpson's 1/3 rule. If there are an odd number of intervalsm the trapezoidal rule is used on the last interval
